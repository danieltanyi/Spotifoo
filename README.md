# Spotifoo Player ( Tietoevry + Novare ) Individual Project
This is a command line interface (terminal) app that doesnâ€™t have user interface.
# Description
We got the contract for a Swedish startup called Spotifoo, they want to legalize the business of pirating music by creating a subscription service that allows you to stream music instead of downloading it from an unknown source. They want to build a proof of work concept using a basic terminal app, to see what features they should prioritize.
# The challenge is summarised below:
I have a folder called asset that contains 2 sub folders .mp3 files and .png files.
I also have the .txt file with information of the songs , name , artists, albums, genre, file names and albums images.
Now I need to read this files to display the list of songs and other features.

Play a song 		  : #1 on the main menu, the app shows the list of songs by reading the text file

Filter by artists	: #2 on the main menu, the app will replace the main menu options with list of artists on the .txt file

Filter by albums	: #3 on the main menu, get it replaced with list of albums available in the .txt file

Filter by genre		: #4 on the main menu, to show list of genres

Search 			      : #5 on the main menu, to allow you perform search base on the names of the songs
